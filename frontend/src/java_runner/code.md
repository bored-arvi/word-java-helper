## Prerequisites

Before using the output screenshot feature, ensure the following:

- Java is installed and properly configured on your system.
- The application dependencies are installed.
- The `static` directory exists in your project root and has write permissions.

## Output Screenshots

After running your Java code, the application is expected to generate output screenshots automatically. These screenshots are saved in the `static` directory. You can use these images to integrate with the Python docx connection for documentation purposes.

### How to Use

1. Run your Java code as usual.
2. The application will capture the output and save screenshots in the `static` folder.
3. Access the screenshots from `static` for further integration or documentation.

**Note:** Ensure the `static` directory exists and has write permissions.
